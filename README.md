# Warning
This package is deprecated and it will not be updated anymore.
I recommend you the following (as much better!) alternatives:

**Michael Grupp's evo package**

Link: https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo

I used this for my master thesis and is pretty easy to use. Some plots are different that the ones you may encounter in other papers, but has a lot of very useful tools, such as batch processing of trajectories.

**UZH Robotics and Perception Group's Trajectory evaluation toolkit**

Link: https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_trajectory_evaluation

I have not tried this since it is rather new (recently presented in IROS 2018) but these guys have worked on this area for years and gave a talk on this topic in an ICRA 2018 workshop. In addition, figures that seems to be generated by the toolkit are most common in SLAM/localization literature, such as the typical relative pose error (RPE) to compare localization accuracy at different scales.

# slam_metrics
Some scripts to calculate metrics used in SLAM. It works in a similar way to Jürgen Sturm's scripts but this unifies both Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) and Relative Pose Error (RPE), as well as SE(3) ATE and Drift Per Distance Travelled (DDT).

To be used with **Python 3**

## Usage
The main file is `evaluate_metrics.py`. To run, you must execute:

```bash
python evaluate_metrics.py ground_truth_file estimation_file
```

By default, it only provides the absolute RMSE in both translation and orientation. Please check the options to enable the computation of other error statistics.

## Options
Other options available are:

`--offset float`: time offset added to the timestamps of the second file (default: 0.0)

`--scale`: scaling factor for the second trajectory (default: 1.0)

`--max_pairs`: maximum number of pose comparisons (default: 10000, set to zero to disable downsampling)

`--max_difference`: maximally allowed time difference for matching entries (default: 0.02)

`--delta`: delta for evaluation (default: 1.0)

`--delta_unit`: unit of delta: `'s'` for seconds, `'m'` for meters, `'rad'` for radians, `'f'` for frames; default: `'s'`

`--fixed_delta`: only consider pose pairs that have a distance of delta delta_unit (e.g., for evaluating the drift per second/meter/radian)

`--verbose`: print all evaluation data (otherwise, only the RMSE absolute will be printed

`--compute_automatic_scale`: `ATE_Horn` computes the absolute scale using the mod by Raul Mur
